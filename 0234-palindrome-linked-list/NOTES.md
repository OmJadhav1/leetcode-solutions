in this what we have done is
1. find the middle
2. reverse the ll from middle->next
3. then check both parts of ll i.e. from head and from reverse middle->next
4. if equal true else false;
5. if you want you can reverse again the reverse ll to make it original and then return.

in this i dont know why it is not working for 2 node ll so i handled that separetly
